# Hi, Nice to meet you!

### 🚀 About Me
I'm a self-taught developer passionate about math, FOSS, and problem-solving.

Most of my day work involves APIs, integrating services, and optimizing processes. I'm always looking for new ways to improve efficiency in my code.

But this year, my goal is to make open source contributions 

Additionally, I really like video games 🎮 and I enjoy exploring game development as well in my free time.
